# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its defined bounds. This results in a runtime exception.

The `BugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code, demonstrating how to avoid this error by carefully checking array boundaries.

This example is valuable for understanding and preventing `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` errors in Java applications. It showcases a fundamental aspect of array handling that many programmers encounter early in their learning journey.
